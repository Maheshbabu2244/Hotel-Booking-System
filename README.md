ML-Based Hotel Booking Prediction System
A Machine Learning (ML)-based Hotel Booking Prediction System is designed to analyze customer booking behaviors and predict whether a reservation will be confirmed, canceled, or modified. The system utilizes historical booking data, customer demographics, seasonal trends, and other relevant factors to improve hotel revenue management, optimize room allocation, and reduce last-minute cancellations.

Key Components:
Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Collects past booking data, including customer details, booking date, check-in/check-out dates, cancellation history, and payment methods.
Cleans and preprocesses data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Feature Engineering:

Identifies key features such as lead time, room type, previous cancellations, booking source, and special requests.
Extracts additional features like seasonality, day of the week, and customer loyalty status.
Model Selection & Training:

Implements ML models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks to classify whether a booking will be confirmed or canceled.
Uses Supervised Learning with labeled datasets for model training.
Evaluation & Optimization:

Measures performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.
Fine-tunes hyperparameters using Grid Search or Random Search.
Deployment & Integration:

Integrates the trained model into hotel management systems to provide real-time predictions.
Uses API-based solutions to interact with online booking platforms and revenue management software.
Benefits:
✅ Reduces cancellation rates by identifying high-risk bookings.
✅ Improves room occupancy rates by forecasting demand.
✅ Enhances customer targeting by analyzing booking behavior.
✅ Supports dynamic pricing strategies for better revenue management.

Use Cases:
Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like Booking.com, Expedia, and Airbnb.
Hotel Chains for efficient resource allocation.
Revenue Management Teams to optimize pricing and promotions.
